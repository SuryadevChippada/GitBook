# The Baader–Meinhof Phenomenon: Why You Suddenly See That Thing Everywhere

Have you ever learned a new word, bought a specific car model, or discovered a new band, and then you start seeing or hearing it everywhere?

You’re not losing your mind.

What you’re experiencing is the **Baader–Meinhof Phenomenon**, also called the **Frequency Illusion**.

***

### So, what is the frequency illusion?

The **Frequency Illusion** happens when something you’ve recently noticed suddenly feels like it’s popping up all the time.

In reality, its frequency hasn’t changed.

You’ve just become more aware of it.

Researchers describe this as a gap between **objective reality** and **subjective experience**.

We often judge frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.

Psychologists call that the **availability heuristic**.

If it’s easy to remember, it _feels_ more frequent.

### What’s going on in your brain?

This isn’t just attention.

A few deeper mental processes are at work.

First, your brain filters most information out.

When something becomes relevant—like a word you learned or a car you bought—your brain flags it as important.

Then you start noticing it more.

Second, after a few sightings, your brain starts collecting “evidence”:

> “See? I knew it. It really _is_ everywhere.”

Research also shows we overestimate rare events and underestimate common ones.

That mix makes the illusion feel even stronger.

Not all researchers call this “irrational.”

Some argue it’s a reasonable guess from limited information.

Your brain isn’t broken.

It’s making fast calls with incomplete data.

### Proof that this happens in real life

This effect isn’t just anecdotal.

Researchers analyzed Dutch publications across more than a century.

People regularly claimed certain words were “suddenly everywhere.”

When compared to usage data, most claims were illusions.

Other studies found something counterintuitive.

The more common something actually is, the worse we are at judging its frequency.

Our perception doesn’t scale linearly.

It flattens out.

Once something passes a threshold, our brain just labels it “a lot.”

### Why this matters

This isn’t just a fun fact.

It affects real decisions.

We judge trends, risks, popularity, and even truth based on how often we _think_ we encounter something.

Repeated information also feels more believable, even when it’s false.

Combine that with the Frequency Illusion.

Now certain ideas can feel dominant, even if they aren’t.

Algorithms and social feeds amplify repetition.

So this effect hits harder than ever.

### The big takeaway

The Baader–Meinhof Phenomenon is a reminder that **perception isn’t reality**.

Our brains are great at finding patterns.

Sometimes they turn the volume up too high.

Next time you think:

> “Why am I seeing this everywhere all of a sudden?”

Ask:

> “Did it become more common—or did I just learn to notice it?”

Chances are it was always there.

You just unlocked it in your awareness.

That’s completely normal.
