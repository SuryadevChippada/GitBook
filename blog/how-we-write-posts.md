# How we write posts

## How we write posts

This format keeps posts scannable.

### Structure

1. **Title**: state the outcome.
2. **Lead**: 2–3 sentences of context.
3. **Body**: headings every few paragraphs.
4. **Try it**: exact steps.
5. **Next**: what’s coming.

### Style rules

* Use short sentences.
* Prefer verbs over nouns.
* Use numbers and specifics.
* Don’t bury the lede.

### Publishing checklist

* [ ] Add a short description.
* [ ] Add one clear call to action.
* [ ] Link to docs or PRs.
* [ ] Add “Known issues” if needed.
* [ ] Re-read on mobile.
